    Every now and then I check my little trading app and have a look at the stocks. And sometimes, a certain exercise stock on the trending tab would catch my eye. A black logo with a simple white circle design. I know that business, it's that exercise bike company Pelaton. Quickly scanning the name I see letters that confirm my assumption.
  </p><p>
    "Holy shit, this stock is going mental, I didn't realise Peloton made so much money" I think to myself. This happens occasionally throughout the year and Peloton is apparently a 100 billion dollar company. üöÄüöÄüöÄ

    I was surprised how quiet park was last night exactly around when you are talking about.    It was only my second run back since NYC and I have many friends who still haven't run.

    There are something like 15K New Yorkers who ran the marathon. Nearly all of them will be doing training programs, those programs prescribe ~35-50+ miles of running per week, including a weekend "long run".
